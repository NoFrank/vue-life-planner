> A sample App for Vue.js

This is a fictional sample app to demonstrate different options and architectural patterns in Vue.js-apps.
It is in itself not meant to be a "best practice" app, because many different approaches are mixed in one app,
which should be avoided in real apps. Some of the examples are 'artificial' and you would use that approach only
in bigger apps. But for the purpose of demonstrating different ways and giving a basis for custom experiments,
this shouldn't be a problem.

You will find many comments in the source and links to the official documentation. This is work in progress. Don't
take everything as 'this is how it should be' but as a starting point to play around with different approaches and toform your own opinion.
